## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-26

Major refactor: streaming runtime API, audit emission migrated to arctrust, spawn primitive moved up to arcagent (separation of concerns), and stricter manifest enforcement at all tiers.

### Added

- **Streaming runtime API** (`streams.py`) — `run_stream()` wraps `run()` and yields typed `StreamEvent` subclasses (`TokenEvent`, `ToolStartEvent`, `ToolEndEvent`, `TurnEndEvent`) for real-time output. Pure arcrun — no LLM-level streaming required; token text is derived from the final response and emitted progressively. `TurnEndEvent` always closes the stream.
- **Audit-event tests** — `tests/unit/backends/test_audit_events.py` and `tests/unit/test_streams_audit_events.py` lock down the events emitted by the new audit path.
- **Manifest-always-required test** — `tests/unit/backends/test_manifest_always_required.py` verifies signed-manifest enforcement across personal/enterprise/federal tiers (ADR-019).

### Changed

- **Audit emission migrated to arctrust** — All loop, tool, and backend audit events now emit through `arctrust.audit.emit(AuditEvent, sink)`. Single canonical schema; sinks fan out to JSONL, signed chain, and UI bridge. arcrun no longer constructs raw audit dicts.
- **Pairing/manifest signature required at every tier** — `UnsafeNoOp` skill verification bypass eliminated. Personal tier still verifies; only the keyset and stringency differ from federal.
- **Public API surface** — `streams` module added to the package export surface; legacy spawn entry points removed.
- **README rewritten** — Marketing prose replaced with a focused layer-position + public-surface reference.

### Removed

- **`arcrun.builtins.spawn`** — Spawn primitives moved to `arcagent.orchestration.spawn`. arcrun stays a pure loop; arcagent owns sub-run orchestration. Implements the concern split documented in `arcagent/orchestration/__init__.py` and the project CLAUDE.md.

### Security

- **Audit single-point-of-emission** — Aligned with ADR-019; arcrun no longer can drift from the canonical schema.
- **No-bypass verification** — Manifest signature is checked at every tier; `UnsafeNoOp` removed from the verification path.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-18

SPEC-017 loop hardening: parallel tool dispatch, structured task completion, budget caps.

### Added

- **Parallel tool dispatch** (`parallel_dispatch.py`) — `BatchClassifier` partitions tool batches by classification (read-only vs state-modifying) with an implicit-dependency heuristic (shared path args force sequential). `ParallelDispatcher` runs read-only batches via `asyncio.gather(return_exceptions=True)` bounded by `asyncio.Semaphore` (default 10, FIPS mode 4). `SequentialDispatcher` fallback for mixed batches. `dispatch_batch()` is the top-level entry point. Submission-order result preservation regardless of completion order. Optional monotonic sequence numbers for audit ordering.
- **`task_complete` builtin** (`builtins/task_complete.py`) — Structured loop-termination signal. `TaskCompleteArgs` Pydantic model with `status` (`success|partial|failed`), `summary`, optional `artifacts`/`next_steps`/`error`. `make_task_complete_tool()` for registration, `make_budget_breach_args()` helper for programmatic budget-breach payloads.
- **Loop termination integration** (`strategies/react.py`) — React strategy detects `task_complete` calls per turn, emits `loop.completed` event with the payload, and terminates cleanly.
- **Budget caps** — `RunState` gains `max_cost_usd` and `completion_payload`. React strategy enforces `max_turns` (synthesized `failed` completion) and `max_cost_usd` (checked before each turn) per SPEC-017 R-032.

### Changed

- **Strategy prompt provider** — Strategies now expose `prompt_guidance` (abstract property on `Strategy` ABC) describing when and how the model should leverage each execution strategy. New `get_strategy_prompts()` public API assembles guidance sections for spawning, code execution, and strategy selection based on active tools and allowed strategies. Prompts flow UP to the agent layer without breaking separation of concerns.
- **Public API** — `get_strategy_prompts()` and `parallel_dispatch` module added to the `arcrun` export surface.
- **`RunState`** — New optional fields `completion_payload`, `max_cost_usd`. Backward-compatible defaults so existing callers are unaffected.

### Fixed

- **`TestThreadSafeEventBus.test_lock_exists`** — Works on Python 3.13 where `threading.Lock` became a factory rather than a type.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed

- **Code formatting & lint compliance** — Applied consistent formatting across all source files: multi-line function signatures, explicit `strict=False` on `zip()` calls, expanded `bus.emit()` calls for readability. Zero ruff violations.
- **Ruff lint config** — Added comprehensive rule selection (`E`, `W`, `F`, `I`, `N`, `UP`, `B`, `A`, `S`, `T20`, `RUF`) and per-file ignores for tests, sandbox builtins, and walkthroughs.
- **Import modernization** — Replaced `typing.Callable` with `collections.abc.Callable` per PEP 585 (`UP` rules).
- **Exception type update** — `asyncio.TimeoutError` replaced with builtin `TimeoutError` per Python 3.11+ deprecation.
- **Spawn string formatting** — Simplified f-string concatenation in child system prompt construction.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Tamper-evident event chain** — SHA-256 hash chain on all events. Each event contains `sequence`, `prev_hash`, and `event_hash` fields. Genesis event uses `"0" * 64` as prev_hash. `verify_chain()` validates integrity of the full audit trail.
- **Immutable events** — `Event` dataclass is now `frozen=True` with `MappingProxyType` data field. Events cannot be mutated after creation.
- **Chain verification API** — `verify_chain(events)` returns `ChainVerificationResult` with `valid`, `verified_count`, `first_invalid_index`, and `error` fields.
- **Container sandbox** — `make_contained_execute_tool()` factory creates a Docker-isolated Python execution tool. Runs agent-generated code in ephemeral containers with configurable memory limits, CPU quotas, network isolation, and read-only filesystems.
- **Sandbox error hierarchy** — `SandboxError` base with `SandboxTimeoutError`, `SandboxOOMError`, `SandboxRuntimeError`, and `SandboxUnavailableError` subtypes for precise error handling.
- **Adversarial security test suite** — 36 tests across 8 categories covering OWASP LLM Top 10 and OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 attack vectors:
  - Prompt injection (LLM01, ASI01)
  - Path traversal (ASI05)
  - Steering injection (ASI01, ASI06)
  - Tool injection (ASI02, ASI04)
  - Resource exhaustion (LLM10, ASI08)
  - Spawn depth bomb (ASI08)
  - Event tampering (AU-9, AU-10)
  - Timing attacks (AU-8)
- **Security documentation** — Threat model, NIST 800-53 control mapping, and adversarial test catalog in `docs/security/`.
- **Spawn E2E tests** — End-to-end tests for recursive task decomposition with spawn tool.
- **Container execute tests** — Unit tests for Docker sandbox including timeout, OOM, and network isolation scenarios.

### Changed

- **Event dataclass** — Now `frozen=True` (immutable). `data` field changed from `dict` to `MappingProxyType` for deep immutability.
- **EventBus** — Maintains hash chain state (`_sequence`, `_prev_hash`). Thread-safe via `threading.Lock`. Emits events with computed hashes.
- **Types** — `LoopResult.events` now contains hash-chained events. Added `SandboxConfig` fields for container mode.
- **Builtins __init__** — Re-exports sandbox error types and contained execute factory.

### Security

- Hash chain provides tamper-evident audit trail meeting NIST 800-53 AU-9 (Protection of Audit Information) and AU-10 (Non-Repudiation).
- Container sandbox isolates agent-generated code execution (OWASP ASI05 — Unexpected Code Execution / RCE).
- Event immutability prevents post-emission tampering of audit records.
- Adversarial test suite validates resilience against 8 attack categories.
